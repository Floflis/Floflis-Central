Floflis Central home.html: screen brightness and other widgets!
"

- centralize leftSidebar's items, by using margin-left/margin-right trick

- fix popper.js issue
- support parameters/--flags for opening in specific tab (useful for Explore menu, that will open directly in "More settings" tab) https://stackoverflow.com/a/64613200 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-line-arguments-in-electronjs/ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30815446/how-to-pass-command-line-argument-in-electron
- .desktop shortcut+classic-icon for Floflis Update

- "in cpu-arch, also tell its codename (i386, amd64)" (HAVE TO IMPROVE THIS, by supporting ARM rather than assuming everything's x86)

- if first use, require user to read Terms of Use (can be removed of token distribution according to internal criteria. But existing FLOF tokens you own can't be taken; they're yours)

-? make Central smarter (such as not bugging when username JSON not found), and move imgs/assets to the HTML repo (FMWK C2 template will follow this example)
- also, for a smarter Central: renew routing, use more functions and external common event-sheets

- Build from source (Floflis Packager/Plugz, c2export and its Central/HTML and scripts)
-
- fix icon (with help of a update for floflis-packager)
-
- init script (installs shared libs, creates c2export and its files, clones Central (HTML) and scripts)

- If Cinnamon avatar isn't found, display generic (/media/daniell/UBUNTU1/avatar.png)
- If Cinnamon, disable the "Change lockscreen bg" (but show background on it) card and "Change both" button. On other DEs, tell it will be implemented

- integrate IPFS (also display peerid)

- can enter fullscreen with F11, but can't exit it with same F11 (also, F11 works in any place of the desktop despite Central's window not visible)

- If no Internet, don't display 0 tokens if already non-zero, but tell balance outdated

- Profile tab: remove "Estimated total USD you hold" from card
- Display estimated total USD on every token count

- If user have no ETH address/fullname in user.json, display error (validation)

- Detect if it is running from ISO (live), and change features accordingly (remove user features, add shortcuts for Ubiquity)

- scripts will use external functions (tokenbalance-others.sh, nfts-parse.sh) in their own folders (include tokenbalance.sh)
- independence for fullname.sh (own repo)

- "Copy to clipboard" button at ETH address and ENS name

- new C2 project: Bitaverse secret base. Floflis user will have a secret base and a quintal outside, merging all of its axies + allowlisted ethermons living happily at the same place.
